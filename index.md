# nosocial: Get to the point (and it’s okay!)
I was recently reintroduced to the *nohello* concept and I'm reminded how much I like it! Like everyone who spends a lot of time online for their job, I too had seen too many "Hi" messages left hanging in space. 

If you haven't seen what I'm talking about, take a moment to go check out [Sebastien's page](https://github.com/sbmueller) or [nohello.com](http://www.nohello.com/). It’s worth a quick read.

So what’s different here? Not much. This page is just to let colleagues know: when you reach out on chat, it’s perfectly fine to skip the small talk and go straight to your question or update. No need to worry about saying things like:
<pre>
Hi..
How is everything going?
Are you busy?
</pre>
Chat isn’t the same as in-person or phone. For work-related questions, getting straight to the point is okay—no offense taken if you skip the greeting. 👍

This is an amendment of [Sebastien's](https://github.com/sbmueller) copy of the original website nohello.com. Acknowledgements go to the original anonymous author. I'm Antipodean and we tend to like direct, no BS communication. I can appreciate this approach isn't for everyone. The opinion's expressed under nosocial are my own and not my employer. The source of this file is publicly available on github.com.

I don’t dislike social touchpoints—they’re great when paired with real content. What I’m trying to avoid are messages that are *only* social with nothing else. If you’ve got an update, action, or insight, include that so the thread stays useful.
